## Face Detection
Face detection and recognition using Bollywood celebrity faces.

### Source Data
A part of (more than 1000 observations) the [Bollywood celebrity faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/havingfun/100-bollywood-celebrity-faces) was picked from Kaggle for face recognition purposes. The raw data contains images of different sizes for 13 different Bollywood celebrities. 

### Models
Faces will be explored using Haar-like Classifiers in OpenCV. Features will be extracted using MTCNN. Classification tasks are finished using self-built CNNs and pre-trained models in Keras such as AlexNet and ResNet. Eventually FaceNet will be used to obtain embeddings and celebrities are classified using a simple SVM or MLP. We use the renowned pre-trained FaceNet keras model (in h5 format) which is available online.
